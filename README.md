# raspberryPi
## Description
This is the code that is to be installed and run on the Raspberry Pi.
Currently, the only project on the Raspberry Pi is a proxy server to the cameras on CARL. This will host a webpage for people to see live video feed from CARL, without directly slowing down the Jetson with an overload of connections.
